Java-Dino
=========

Old Java game with dinosaurs! Made originally as a web applet, but due to it lacking proper certificates (and thus not running with the new java update), no link is provided. Screenshot is included and you can imagine the fierce dynamics and excitement that take place during a steaming session of dinos-shooting-meteors.
